## Unity 101 for C# Developers - Andy Clarke

## Unity Networking
A cleaned up version of the Unity networking code I used in my session at DDDSW.

**Getting Started**
I've included built binaries, so if you just want to have look at the exe running
on windows you can use that.

For playing around with the Source you need a copy of Unity and Visual Studio
(or your favourite C# editor).

You'll want to open the scene in Unity - "Source/Assets/Networking.unity"

Enjoy :)
